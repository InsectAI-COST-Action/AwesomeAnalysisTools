## 1. Data Cleaning and Processing Tools

### 1.1 Image cleaning

| Tool Name     | Description                            | Programming language | Available | Open Source? | Links |
|:--------------|:---------------------------------------|:---------------------|:----------|:-------------|:------|
| ImgDupes | Github library to find duplicate images | Python | Yes | Open Source | [github](https://github.com/knjcode/imgdupes) |
| Imagededup | Python library for remove the duplicate images | Python | Yes | Open Source | [github](https://github.com/idealo/imagededup) |
| Exif.tools | Online tool to view and edit image metadata, like file type, file size, bits per pixel, background color etc. | Web-based | Yes | Freeware | [website](https://exif.tools/) |
| Pillow | Python library that controls whether a file can open or not. So broken files can be easily removed from the dataset. | Python | Yes | Open Source | [website](https://pypi.org/project/pillow/) |
